Camel Transacted JMS example
----------------------------

This example demonstrates using the camel-jms component with Red Hat Fuse on EAP to produce and consume JMS messages in a transacted session.

In this example, a Camel route consumes files from ${JBOSS_HOME}/standalone/data/orders and places their contents onto an in-memory ActiveMQ Artemis JMS queue named 'OrdersQueue'. A second route consumes any messages from 'OrdersQueue', converts the message body to an 'Order' entity and persists it to an in-memory database table named 'orders'.

If the order quantity is greater than 10, the Camel route throws an exception and the database / JMS transaction is rolled back.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Maven
* An application server with Red Hat Fuse installed

Running the example
-------------------

To run the example.

1. Set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable to point at the root directory of your application server installation:

    For Linux:

        export JBOSS_HOME=...

    For Windows:

        set JBOSS_HOME=...

2. Start the application server in standalone mode:

    For Linux:

        ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml

    For Windows:

        %JBOSS_HOME%\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml

3. Build and deploy the project `mvn install -Pdeploy`. Note that this Maven command also invokes the CLI script
   `configure-jms-queues.cli` that creates the JMS queue.

4. Browse to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-jms-tx/orders

You should see a page titled 'Orders Received'. As we send orders to the example application, a list of processed orders will be listed on this page.

Testing Camel Transacted JMS
----------------------------

There are some example order XML files within the `src/main/resources/orders` directory.

* order-1.xml - Wireless keyboard, quantity 4
* order-2.xml - Wireless mouse, quantity 12
* order-3.xml - HDMI cable, quantity 1
* order-4.xml - Network cable, quantity 6
* order-5.xml - Power cable, quantity 2

Camel will choose a file at random every 15 seconds and will copy it into ${JBOSS_HOME}/standalone/data/orders for processing.

Once the files have been consumed, you can return to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-jms-tx/orders. You should see that only the wireless keyboard and HDMI cable product orders were processed. What happened to the order contained within order-2.xml for the wireless mouse?

Look at the EAP server console output. The output should show a sequence of events similar to the following.

    [stdout] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Hibernate: insert into orders (productName, productSku, quantity, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
    [route3] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Order quantity is greater than 10 - rolling back transaction!
    [org.apache.camel.processor.DefaultErrorHandler] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Rollback (MessageId: queue_OrdersQueue_ID_8cc15741-cc92-11e4-8896-83967a57e23a on ExchangeId: ID-localhost-localdomain-51738-1426589044701-2-5) due: null
    [stdout] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Hibernate: call next value for hibernate_sequence
    [stdout] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Hibernate: insert into orders (productName, productSku, quantity, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
    [route3] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Order processed successfully
    [stdout] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Hibernate: call next value for hibernate_sequence
    [stdout] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Hibernate: insert into orders (productName, productSku, quantity, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
    [route3] (Camel (jms-camel-context) thread #1 - JmsConsumer[OrdersQueue]) Order processed successfully

Note the second line "Order quantity is greater than 10 - rolling back transaction!". Since the wireless mouse order requested a quantity greater than the number permitted, the entire transaction was rolled back. No order was saved to the 'orders' database table and the JMS message was sent to the dead letter queue, as specified by the RouteBuilder 'onException' policy. Hence it does not show up in the list of received orders.

Undeploy
--------

1. To undeploy the example run `mvn clean -Pdeploy`.

2. Remove JMS queues:

    For Linux:

        ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=remove-jms-queues.cli

    For Windows:

        %JBOSS_HOME%\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=remove-jms-queues.cli
