Camel CXF JAX-WS CDI XML Example
------------------------

This example demonstrates using the camel-cxf component with Red Hat Fuse on EAP to produce and consume JAX-WS web services.

The Camel context configuration is specified in cxfws-cdi-xml-camel-context.xml and is loaded by Camel CDI via the @ImportResource annotation.

In this example, a Camel route takes a message payload from a direct endpoint and passes it on to a CXF producer endpoint. The producer uses the payload to pass arguments to a CXF JAX-WS web service.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Maven
* An application server with Red Hat Fuse installed

Running the example
-------------------

To run the example.

1. Start the application server in standalone mode:

    For Linux:

        ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml

    For Windows:

        %JBOSS_HOME%\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml

2. Build and deploy the project `mvn install -Pdeploy`

3. Browse to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-cxf-jaxws-cdi-xml/

You should see a page titled 'Send A Greeting'. This UI enables us to interact with the test 'greeting' web service which will have also been started. The service WSDL is available at http://localhost:8080/webservices/greeting-cdi-xml?wsdl.

There is a single service operation named 'greet' which takes 2 String parameters named 'message' and 'name'. Invoking the web service will return a response where these values have been concatenated together.

Testing Camel CXF JAX-WS CDI XML
--------------------------------

Web UI
------

Browse to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-cxf-jaxws-cdi-xml/.

From the 'Send A Greeting' web form, enter a 'message' and 'name' into the text fields and press the 'send' button. You'll then see the information you entered combined to display a greeting on the UI.

`CamelCxfWsServlet` handles the POST request from the web UI. It retrieves the message and name form parameter values and constructs an object array. This object array will be the message payload that is sent to the `direct:start` endpoint. A `ProducerTemplate` sends the message payload to Camel. `The direct:start` endpoint passes the object array to a `cxf:bean` web service producer. The web service response is used by `CamelCxfWsServlet` to display the greeting on the web UI.

## Undeploy

To undeploy the example run `mvn clean -Pdeploy`.
